## Document for coding style for Cartoonify!
	
Coding style is a way for team members to synthesize their code for a project. This means that when any code is added or modified in the repository, it is added in a certain fashion. Our team's coding style consists of rules for comments, indentations, and variable names.
	
When we write code we try to add a comment about lines that could be confusing or explain a key step. We do not comment every line, because this can lead to unnecessary redundancy. We comment lines that are useful for explaining concepts, so if another developer comes in to read the code, they can understand what is happening.
    
We also add docstrings to every function that we have written. The docstrings are a few clear sentences to explain what the function is doing and its inputs and outputs.
	
Additionally, our team makes sure that an indent is equivalent to four spaces. We are all very particular that we have the same indents. This is also important because if you do not indent correctly there is a chance the code will not run correctly because we are working in Python. By having a uniform indent, it makes it so that transitioning code between different laptops and developers is easy and efficient.
	
For variable names, we use names that describe what the variable is holding and we use camel case.
	
By maintaining good coding style practices, our team has developed a coding style which is efficient and understandable.
