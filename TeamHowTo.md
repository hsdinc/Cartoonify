## TEAM HOW TO -- GIT BUG TRACKING 

### Pull requests
When pushing new features to the Cartoonify Github Repo, all contributors must participate in a code review. 
All members of the Cartoonify team must review each pull request so that every one can be on the same page 
at all times. Pull requests are set to require at least **4 code reviews**, which ensures that every member of the 
initial 5 Cartoonify members will have seen the changes.
